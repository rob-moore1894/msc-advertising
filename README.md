Welcome to MSC Advertising

This company is owned and operated by Rob Smith.  Rob has been a graphics designer for over 20 years and offers his services to anyone at great rates.  

This concept website was first created on glitch.com to ensure that we have a base design and can be operational without a budget.  The site was developed with the Bootstrap framework.
The future creation of the site will be for the customer to place orders and make payments online.  As of this writing, the plan is to utilize the Stripe API to incorporate the credit card method,
I may even consider including payments through PayPal.  Rob Smith operates another business and as long as this is developed properly, we will create another site for his other business.

This website was developed by Rob Moore.  See other projects at https://github.com/rob-moore1894
